# Grid Sandbox

You are God. Your gowal is to make a certain material. You are given a grid of cells. Each of the cells may be a different type of ore. 

The tutorial could be a simple thing where you are shown an iron ore and you can place a drill on it or something. I'm not to sure but that could be a simple and easy way to teach the prtemise of the videogame.
